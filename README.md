Mate, this is just for fun! I love football and combined it with my hobby, so yupp, playing the FIFA World Cup song using a buzzer! Gosh, sounds crazy, innit?  

All you have to do is upload this code to your Arduino, connect the buzzer’s positive line to pin 8 and the negative to GND, and voila, there you go!  

I know it’s nothing special, but y’know, fun projects!! Thanks!!!
